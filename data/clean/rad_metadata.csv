Appeals by Country of Alleged Persecution,rad_appeals,"The table includes all intake: appeals by the claimant or by the Minister that have not yet been decided by the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), and appeals that have been returned to the RAD from the Federal Court.

Appeals finalized in a given year may have been filed in a previous year.
The country of alleged persecution in the table below corresponds to the first listed country of alleged persecution as identified by the claimant when they made their claim before the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), and which was entered in the case management system.
Only countries for which an appeal was filed, finalized, or pending within this reporting period are displayed.
The table below reflects the data on countries contained within the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) case management system and is used solely to support the refugee determination process. The fact that these countries are listed should not be construed as implying that the IRB recognizes these particular countriesâ€™ sovereignty or political status.
Furthermore, country names may not accurately reflect the current geopolitical situation; rather, they reflect the information as it currently exists in the IRB case management system and some are corrected by researchers for consistency."
