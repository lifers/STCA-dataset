This represents a spending increase of $48.8M compared to 2017?18 actuals.

The increase in FTEs is due to increase in the volume of work. Increase in the maximum payment from $3,977 to $7,148 made retroactive to all WEPP claims on or after February 27, 2018, led to the reconsideration of a large volume of processed applications.

As a result, the Secretariat did not have a baseline for budget planning purposes or expenditure trends to inform all of its financial planning for its first full year of operation, and therefore attributed the bulk of expenditures under its core responsibility. The Secretariat’s expenditures in 2018-19 are attributable to two main areas: personnel and the construction of the organization’s permanent facility. 

The variance between total authorities available for use and actual spending in 2018-19 is attributable to the construction of the Secretariat’s permanent facility. The project was delayed in 2017-18 and the majority of work pushed into 2018-19. As a result, the Secretariat moved funding from the 2017-18 fiscal year into 2018-19 to ensure sufficient financial flexibility to address construction-related expenditures. The majority of these costs were paid in 2018-19.

With regards to planned human resources for its core responsibility, the Secretariat reports 8.2 full-time equivalents in 2018-19.

As noted above, with the absence of baseline expenditure data, the Secretariat forecast the bulk of its expenditures for the 2018-19 fiscal year under its core responsibility.

The data for this indicator is from the annual Sustainability Survey for Fisheries managed by NFP. The indicator’s denominator is the total number of major fish stocks tracked through the survey (Healthy or Cautious + Uncertain) in any given year and the numerator is the number of major stocks in the Healthy or Cautious zones. Between 2014-15 and 2018-19 the number of fish stocks with an Uncertain status has increased from 27 (or 17% of the total stocks) to 73 (41% of the total stocks).  This increase is attributed to changes in the survey tool, as well as an increased rigour around data collection including the validation of survey results. The validation of the survey data after it’s been received led to stocks switching from being in the Healthy or Cautious zone, to an Uncertain status. This validation has resulted in a better understanding of the true status of stocks overtime and an accompanying change to the target to reflect this new “baseline”.",The variance between planned and actual spending is primarily due to funding that will be spent in future years in order to meet program requirements.

In addition to revenues from assessments, FCAC receives an annual statutory expenditure of a maximum of $5,000,000 to support the financial literacy of Canadians. 

FCAC’s total expenses for fiscal year 2019-20 were $30.6 million, an increase of $5.0 million, or 19% compared to the previous fiscal year. This was primarily due to increases in personnel costs, information costs and professional services related to the implementation of new legislation, which created a stronger federal Financial Consumer Protection Framework (FCPF).

Personnel costs, FCAC’s largest expense, rose by $2.8 million, or 16%. The increase is a result of growth required to support the implementation of the new FCPF, a new supervision framework, and a more comprehensive approach to supervision and enforcement. Furthermore, FCAC completed the repatriation of human resources and finance functions that allowed the Agency to operate more efficiently and reduce costs. Information costs increased by $0.7 million mainly due to its advertising campaign, which focused primarily on home equity lines of credit. Professional services increased by $0.4 million mainly as a result of expenses incurred for the modernization of the Agency’s business systems and processes. All other expenses, in total, increased by $1.1 million.

The Office of the Correctional Investigator is one of many oversight agencies that exist to provide independent assurance to Canadians and parliamentarians that the delivery of federal services and programs is done in an open, transparent and accountable manner. The notion of righting a wrong is central to the Ombudsman role. An Ombudsman exists to provide independent, objective perspective on the fairness of government services – to counterbalance the relative strength of public institutions against the individual. A successful ombudsman is one who increases public confidence in public administration. To that end, the Office of the Correctional Investigator provides access to every federal offender to our Ombudsman services via the investigation of individual complaints and systemic concerns.  Recommendations to the Correctional Service of Canada are non-binding. On this point, it is imperative that the organization and its program not become just another management component of the body it is mandated by law to oversee. If the organization is to remain effective, the public and government must see the role as independent and impartial.","In fiscal 2019-20, nearly all positions in OCI were staffed for the first time.  However, new collective agreement with increased rates of pay and retro-payments to staff from agreements dating back to 2018, meant that over $400,000 in back-pay was paid to staff that was not forecasted in the budget.  The delays from Phoenix processing and correcting of staff pay placed a substantial financial pressure on the organization."

The ERC planned complement of resourced FTEs through 2019-20 is 17 (comprising indeterminate employees, employees on secondment or term appointment, positions resourced through service arrangements, and Governor-in-Council appointees on the Committee).  The planned FTE complement lowers to six beginning in 2021-22, when the temporary program integrity funding will have ended.

The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat granted the ERC an exemption from reporting on Internal Services as a separate program beginning in 2009-10 (given the focused nature of the ERC program and associated resources).  This Report, therefore, presents information based on a single ERC program and does not provide information on Internal Services separately.","Planned staffing was 17 FTEs following the approval of program integrity funding in Fall 2017, with 14.9 FTEs actually used during the course of 2019-20.

This review analyzes a contemporary threat to the rights and freedoms of Canadians and Canadian society and institutions. It also examines the government’s response to foreign interference through the lens of Canadian Fundamental Institutions (CFIs) to assess the government’s strategy to protect CFIs.

•	The Canada Border Services Agency’s (CBSA’s) national security and intelligence activities. This review marks the first independent, external review of the national security and intelligence activities of the CBSA. This review seeks to establish a baseline of knowledge on the agency’s role in the security and intelligence community, its authorities to conduct national security and intelligence activities, and the existing governance and oversight structures surrounding these activities. 

•	Diversity and inclusion in the security and intelligence community. This review examines the degree of representation of designated groups (women, Aboriginal people, persons with disabilities, and members of visible minority groups) within organizations in the security and intelligence community. It also considers the goals, initiatives, programs and measures that departments and agencies have taken to address inclusion.

All other expenditures will be attributed to the Core Responsibility.

A strong, accessible and timely complaint process is essential to the credibility of both the Commission and the RCMP. The Commission has made use of leading-edge communication tools and online technology to provide Canadians with an accessible and efficient way to voice their concerns. The Commission has streamlined and simplified its online complaint process resulting in a significant increase in the number of complaints received online and improved processing times.
Through effective monitoring of the RCMP’s response to public complaints, as well as a robust review process that leads to findings and recommendations when necessary, the Commission aims to effect change and foster public confidence in the RCMP. By augmenting its internal capacity to conduct complaint reviews and independent investigations, gather and analyze relevant data, and track the manner in which its recommendations are accepted and implemented by the RCMP, the Commission adds credibility to the complaint and review processes.
In the fiscal 2020–21 period, the Commission will:
• Continue its refinement of the complaint and review intake processes.
• Continue to track actions taken by the RCMP with respect to recommendations contained in the Commission’s earlier reports.
• Enhance the Commission’s data collection, statistical integration, analysis and reporting functions.","Erratum note: Actual expenditure figure for this program is $4,741,493.46."

It is of paramount importance that the review of police conduct, policy and practice be conducted independently, particularly where an incident attracts wide public interest and there is a public perception that the RCMP may not be impartial in its investigation of the incident. In the fiscal 2020–21 period, the Commission will:
• Eliminate the backlog of review files.
• Reallocate resources to enable completion of review files within the Commission’s stated service standards.
• Continue the refinement of its major case management system and processes.
Conducting reviews of specified RCMP activities contributes to the increased transparency and public accountability of the RCMP. These reviews are supported by independent research and systemic examinations of policies, procedures and training, among other issues.
During the fiscal 2020–21 period, the Commission will complete its specified activity reviews of:
- RCMP use of strip searches;

The decrease in operational and salary funding aligns with the funding profile for the Indigenous ELCC Initiative which envisaged streamlined federal administrative processes and a progressive transfer of jurisdiction and program management activities to Indigenous governments.","The variance between planned and actual spending is due to funding received in-year from the 2020 Fall Economic Statement (FES) and Budget 2021 which increased the actual spending compared to planned.

CSLP is expecting to issue an additional $1.5B in grants during loan year 2020-2021 (August 2020 and July 2021). A part of the extra grants will be issued during fiscal year 2021-2022, explaining a variance of roughly $340M over fiscal year 2023-2024. The rest of the variance comes from the impact of this measure on the alternative payment to non-participating jurisdictions*. The full impact of doubling the grants will be accounted for in the calculation of the alternative payment for fiscal year 2021-2022. The Program expects an increase of roughly $295M in alternative payment due to the temporary doubling of grants measure. Together, the increase in grants ($340M) and the increase in alternative payment ($295M), explain the variance in planned spending between fiscal year 2021-2022 and 2023-2024. *The alternative payment is based on the Net cost of the CSLP Program and the pro rata of the population (18-24 y-old) in the non-participating jurisdictions versus the rest of Canada.",The variance between planned and actual spending is mainly due to the disbursement of Canada Student Grants (CSGs) that was $1.275 billion higher than planned. This higher disbursement is the result of the temporary doubling of CSGs during the pandemic. This was not accounted for as the announcement for the extension of the doubling of grants was not known when the planned spending estimate in the Departmental Plan was prepared.

This increase is offset by a decrease in the actual spending of the Canada Learning Bond (CLB). This is explained by the fact that the pandemic persisted longer than expected which had a significant impact on the number of CLB beneficiaries. The actual number of new CLB beneficiaries was 20% lower than the projections for the fiscal year 2021 to 2022 (when the department expected a recovery). The drop was mainly driven by the extended slowdown in various activities required to get the CLB like applying for a Social Insurance Number, filing tax returns, opening a new RESP account, as well as by reduced promotion of the CLB."
